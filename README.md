OpenStreetMap-Norkart
=====================

OpenStreetMap: Norkart announces latin alphabet names in Europe.
 
Norwegian software company Norkart has created an OpenStreetMap PostGIS database for use in Europe outside Norway, where most name-attributes
containing non-latin derived alphabeth characters are transliterated to latin characters. These corrections apply to the bulk of names in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Macedonia
 
According to the OSM odbl-licence, the database is available as PostGIS – database dumps are made available on request. Please contact hans.gunnar.steen@norkart.no if you are interested.    
 
The map produced by the database can be seen on www.webatlas.no
 
The transliteration approach is highly pragmatic – Not all of the original attributes are preserved. Use the data on your own risk and responsibility.
Norkart takes no responsibility whatsoever for errors that may have occurred during data processing.
